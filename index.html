        <p>Welcome! Endless Plotline is just what it sounds like&mdash;a plotline with no definite end. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/endlessplotline">r/endlessplotline</a> is a place that harbours these plotlines. Do keep in mind that, being endless, these plotlines are often very long, but very intentional. In order to maintain order, we ironically use Discord as a means of communication and consistency. Here is the <a href="https://discord.gg/5svmtqM">invitation link!</a> Come and drop a hello, we'd love to have you!</p>

        <h4>Summaries</h4>
        <p><cite>Children of Eana</cite> is perhaps the most expansive plotline, containing many arcs.</p>
        <p>The first arc starts out in the continent of Daz Kardum, in the village of <em>Skadgal</em>, whose Lord is <em>Lord Gairn</em>, on the day of the <em>Choosing</em>. While most young individuals are chosen by beasts (<em>Ooâ€™Kara</em>), Lord Gairn's son, <em>Kei</em>, is instead chosen by a mysterious individual by the name of <em>Wevin</em>. This arc details the interactions between Wevin and Kei as protector and chosen, and the various entities that would prefer Wevin or Kei to be six feet under.</p>
        <p>There are more, but I have no idea what they are.</p>
